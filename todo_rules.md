### Things to evaluate after Playtest:

**Big Things**
- consider moving attack back to the DM.
- add fate points / some mechanics to reroll things
- hybrid abilities necesarry?
- does spell casting system work
- The System should be focused around the Riftlands
  - Think of a way that makes the Riftlands work
  - It should be special and if you want to get to a specific Location it requires something special.

**Minor Things**
- improve layout of character creation 
- maybe make seperate pages for the individual headers
- warlock: rename mystic something else
- adjust equipment item tier
- reduce number of attribute points to 10 maybe
- have another look at the implementation of the martial training perks
- Add Wands and Staffs that enable spell basic attacks
- Robes?

### Planned changes after Playtest:

**Bigger Mechanical Changes**
- When making a d20 the following happens: 20->automatic hit, 1->automatic miss, attack>dodge->hit, dodge>attack->glancing blow(half damage)
- Rescale damage, especially for NPCs to make it less lethal at 1st level, maybe NPCs only deal d6 damage.
- Implement similar system for Spell Damage
- Properly rework Hybrid Abilities, they deserve to stay.
- Shields?

**Smaller Mechanical Changes**
- properly differentiate [FREE] vs 0 [AP]
- Permanent Injuries should only trigger when reduced to 0 [HP] or at Deaths Door.
- Spell Keywords need to be reworked

**Weapon Simplification**
- remove weapon proficency ranks
- each weapon just has 1 unique property
- dagger: light damage, crit lower
- crossbow: fixed damage, ranged/reload, special things can be done with ammo
  - Damage should improve with equipment tier
- Bow, medium damage, ranged, special things can be done with ammo
- versatile weapon: both one-handed and two-handed (medium/heavy damage)
- polarm: reach
- Great Weapon: -2 ATK, treat str 1 higher for Martial damage and attacking two-handed, disadvantage when attacking with one hand

**Ability Simplifications**
- Treat Mechanical Text and Flavour Text seperatly.
- When possible simplify the mechanical text a lot.
- Weapon Attack Ability Should not be referenced in other abilities but instead the equipment should have references for these.

**Character Changes**
- reduce initial attribute points (maybe 10?)
- Remove Class Features and maybe instead have Class Perks, which can be taken instead of Perks, this includes regular class features as well as class paths.
- Class will only have Class Core Feature which improves at level 4/8/12
- For this the Class Core Feature needs to be special and unique (see notes below)
- Should the Class Names Change more to match the Fantasy World?
- Improve the Character Origins to be more in theme with the world, especially they should have motivation for going into the Riftlands.

**Specific Changes**
- Rename Hardness to Stability
- change battle recovery to be less useful than resting.
- Parry should turn crit->hit, hit->glancing, glancing->miss
- use [DR] keyword more often
- adjust travel text since speed is constant.
- rename cleave so in target  that they also need to be within meele ranbge
- Cleric should be able to use holy strike with any attack

### Future Ideas / Nice to have:

create cheet sheet
automatic long rest recovery button.

maybe add shocked Status effect: can't use reactions

add activities that can be done during long rests:
- crafting
- research
- community service
- spend time with loved ones
- Work (Tool, Medicine or smth else)
- go undercover
- improve relations with faction
- religous service
- carousing
- entertainment
- medical servies that speed up healing.s

Massive Injuries should be split into mental and physical, additionally there should be maybe 3 damage type specific tiers.
rule for helping othrs, roll same check, for every 5 above 10 gain +1.
Table for when NPCs drop to 0 [HP] to determine what happens to them.
New keyword: [SAVE LOWERS], status effect gains 1 tier lower.

There should be a move resist stat that deterimes how much less you are moved.
- Tiny: 3x
- Small 2x
- medium 1x
- Large 1/2
- Huge 1/3
- Gargantuan 1/4
- Titanic 1/5s

add faction relations thing (is it relevant for this game?): 
- should be adventure specific
- higher should give you like access to items and other benefits

**Character Creation Builder**
- need a character wizard

**Missing/partially done things**
- Finish out Adventure Section
- flesh out magical misshap table
- add missing spellcasting perk stuff
- add missing keyword descritpions
- proper phrasing of some stuff in the combat

**Classes**
- barbarian nerf resentful strike, should be d6 bonus damage.
  - generally rewrite lots of the barbarian rules
- add missing stuff
- warlock definitly still needing lots of fleshing out
- Make class core abilities more unique:
  - Cleric, Warlock, Barbarian and Mage I am pretty happy
  - Fighter and Rogue need to feel more different.
  - Maybe fighter only has a focus target (oath of moment style) ability and all class techniques are based of that Or maybe fighter can select different stances: Horde Breaker, Beast slayer, Tank and your class techniques change depending on that, you gain Focus 1 per Round and your stance changes how much you gain additionally.
  - Rogue?

**Equipment**
- other useful items, books that give bonuses to lore checks (treats skill as 1 rank higher, can only be affected by [INT]/3 amount of books at the same time, no skill twice)
- magic item rules
- crafting rules
- cooking items
- masterwork: also +1 damage.
- There should be a trinkets table.

**Spells**
- more spells
- finish out the spell discipline specific effects.

**Status Effects:**
- Confused Condition?

**Nice to have**
- have colored abilities and more icons
- add missing abilities
- add linking and tooltips for abilities
- Perktrees
