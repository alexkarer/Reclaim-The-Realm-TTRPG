____________________________________________________________
Things to change/evaluate after Playtest:

**Big Things**
- rethink if attacks should miss at all and dodging should just be a Reaction
  - Every Melee Attack just Hits, additional Effects still require a roll
  - Maybe treat ranged attacks different, or make the concealment check now rely on the attack.
  - Aoe Abilities still work as normal
  - New Reaction to Evade Attack completetly, Parry can do the same thing
  - Damage should probably be rescaled
- add fate points / some mechanics to reroll things
- hybrid abilities necesarry?
- does spell casting system work
  - Should it also use martial damage system?
- Martial Damage
- check if game needs to be simplified
- Weapon properties necesarry?

**Minor Things**
- properly differentiate [FREE] vs 0 [AP]
- improve layout of character creation 
- maybe make seperate pages for the individual headers
- warlock: rename mystic something else
- adjust equipment item tier
- rename harndess to stability
- reduce number of attribute points to 10 maybe
- have another look at the implementation of the martial training perks
- Add Wands and Staffs that enable spell basic attacks
- Robes?
- change battle recovery to be less useful than resting.
- rework the way spell abilities interact with each other.
- Permanent Injuries should only trigger when reduced to 0 [HP] or at Deaths Door.
___________________________________________________________
Future Ideas / Nice to have:

flanking should only work in melee.
create cheet sheet
automatic long rest recovery button.

add activities that can be done during long rests:
- crafting
- research
- community service
- spend time with loved ones
- Work (Tool, Medicine or smth else)
- go undercover
- improve relations with faction
- religous service
- carousing
- entertainment
- medical servies that speed up healing.s

Massive Injuries should be split into mental and physical, additionally there should be maybe 3 damage type specific tiers.
rule for helping othrs, roll same check, for every 5 above 10 gain +1.
Table for when NPCs drop to 0 [HP] to determine what happens to them.
New keyword: [SAVE LOWERS], status effect gains 1 tier lower.

There should be a move resist stat that deterimes how much less you are moved.
- Tiny: 3x
- Small 2x
- medium 1x
- Large 1/2
- Huge 1/3
- Gargantuan 1/4
- Titanic 1/5s

add faction relations thing: 
- should be adventure specific
- higher should give you like access to items and other benefits

**Character Creation Builder**
- need a character wizard

**Missing/partially done things**
- Finish out Adventure Section
- flesh out magical misshap table
- add missing spellcasting perk stuff
- add missing keyword descritpions
- proper phrasing of some stuff in the combat

**Classes**
- barbarian nerf resentful strike, should be d6 bonus damage.
  - generally rewrite lots of the barbarian rules
- add missing stuff
- warlock definitly still needing lots of fleshing out
- Make class core abilities more unique:
  - Cleric, Warlock, Barbarian and Mage I am pretty happy
  - Fighter and Rogue need to feel more different.
  - Maybe fighter only has a focus target (oath of moment style) ability and all class techniques are based of that Or maybe fighter can select different stances: Horde Breaker, Beast slayer, Tank and your class techniques change depending on that, you gain Focus 1 per Round and your stance changes how much you gain additionally.
  - Rogue?

**Equipment**
- other useful items, books that give bonuses to lore checks (treats skill as 1 rank higher, can only be affected by [INT]/3 amount of books at the same time, no skill twice)
- magic item rules
- crafting rules
- cooking items
- masterwork: also +1 damage.
- There should be a trinkets table.

**Spells**
- more spells
- finish out the spell discipline specific effects.

**Status Effects:**
- Confused Condition?

**Nice to have**
- have colored abilities and more icons
- add missing abilities
- add linking and tooltips for abilities

**Travel/Adventure**
- More random Tables
  - Camp Events
  - Travel Events by Terrain
  - Make random tables for weather and encounter similar to how in FG.
  - Special weather and circumstances for Rift Travel: There should be a table describing the Path what kind of Path it is they take (maybe also for other events), what pheonomana they see in the distance or the sky.
  - add some more montage tables/scenes, during travel, which might be the special weather circumstances.
- Change riftlands modifier to only have one d6 in a SPELL CAST TEST Roll.
- Riftlands every week has to make a Willpower or recieve Mental damage (should be a mental permanent injury table).
  - Increases the longer one stays in the Riftlands.
- Add Terrain Tiers
- when travelling, long rest can be made withotu food water but then get exhaustion which can't be recovered.
- Travel encounters should only give 1/4 XP.
