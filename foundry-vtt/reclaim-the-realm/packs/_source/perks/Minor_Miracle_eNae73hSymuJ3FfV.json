They gain the Minor Miracle Ability.</p><p>Each time the Priest uses a Miracle Ability they can’t do so it any more. Once at the start of each day they make a prayer and make a <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">DT</span></strong> 25 <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">SPI ATTRIBUTE TEST</span></strong> which can’t be modified in any other way, on a success they can use miracles again. They can repeat the Test each following day where they reduce the <strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">DT</span></strong> by 5 until they succeed. Alternatively if the Priest Character acts well within their believes or played well the GM may grant them the Miracle again without rolling.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.reclaim-the-realm.coreAbilities.Item.EQRI3889dQW5cdGJ]{Minor Miracle}</p>",
