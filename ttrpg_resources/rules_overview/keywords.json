    "keywords": "During this document you will find Keywords which are listed in Brackets, example: [D20 TEST]. These Keywords are here to clearly indicate what Game Mechanics can interact with other Mechanics. Keywords are also sometimes inherited. For example if a mechanic says it grants you [DISADVANTAGE] on a [D20 TEST] it also effects an [ATTRIBUTE TEST] or [ATTACK]. However if it only grants [DISADVANTAGE] for an [ATTRIBUTE TEST] it will not affect an [ATTACK] ."
