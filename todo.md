Future Ideas / Nice to have:

flanking should only work in melee.

create cheet sheet

add activities that can be done during long rests:
- crafting
- research
- community service
- spend time with loved ones
- community service.
- go undercover
- improve relations with faction
- religous service
- carousing

Massive Injuries should be split into mental and physical, additionally there should be maybe 3 damage type specific tiers.

rule for helping othrs, roll same check, for every 5 above 10 gain +1.

Table for when NPCs drop to 0 [HP] to determine what happens to them.

add faction relations thing: 
- should be adventure specific
- higher should give you like access to items and other benefits

**Character Creation Builder**
- need a character wizard

**Missing/partially done things**
- Finish out Adventure Section
- flesh out magical misshap table
- add missing spellcasting perk stuff
- add missing keyword descritpions
- proper phrasing of some stuff in the combat

**Classes**
- add missing stuff
- warlock definitly still needing lots of fleshing out
- Make class core abilities more unique:
  - Cleric, Warlock, Barbarian and Mage I am pretty happy
  - Fighter and Rogue need to feel more different.
  - Maybe fighter only has a focus target (oath of moment style) ability and all class techniques are based of that Or maybe fighter can select different stances: Horde Breaker, Beast slayer, Tank and your class techniques change depending on that, you gain Focus 1 per Round and your stance changes how much you gain additionally.
  - Rogue?

**Equipment**
- other useful items, books that give bonuses to lore checks (treats skill as 1 rank higher, can only be affected by [INT]/3 amount of books at the same time, no skill twice)
- magic item rules
- crafting rules
- cooking items
- masterwork: also +1 damage.
- There should be a trinkets table.

**Spells**
- more spells
- finish out the spell discipline specific effects.

**Status Effects:**
- Confused Condition?

**Nice to have**
- have colored abilities and more icons
- add missing abilities

**Travel/Adventure**
- More random Tables
  - Camp Events
  - Travel Events by Terrain
  - Make random tables for weather and encounter similar to how in FG.
  - Special weather and circumstances for Rift Travel: There should be a table describing the Path what kind of Path it is they take (maybe also for other events), what pheonomana they see in the distance or the sky.
  - add some more montage tables/scenes, during travel, which might be the special weather circumstances.
- Change riftlands modifier to only have one d6 in a SPELL CAST TEST Roll.
- Add Terrain Tiers
