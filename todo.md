TODO before playtest:

**magic rework**
- when reworking spells make lots of them cost 3 AP (at least all the AOE ones)
  - put absolute spell difficulty in parentheses where currently the spell level was
  - rework athigherPower for all
  - consolidate spells into 1 document
- define magical misshap tables
- fix casting perks, maybe for base school perks let them add to spell cast tests (base thing give you +1, specialization lets you reroll one d6)
- fix spell search view to instead of using spell level, you can filter for ranges of 

**finsh other classes**:
- list what spells and martial maneuvers they are able to learn
- mage todo (rework overcharge)
  - counter should be based on arcana cost or spell-like number in parantheses
- warlock (should be mostly fine, define possession events)
- rogue (implement ideas)
- fighter (implement ideas)

**Equipment**
- add rules for shields
- other items
