Future Ideas / Nice to have:

create cheet sheet

**Missing/partially done things**
- Finish out Adventure Section
- flesh out magical misshap table
- add missing spellcasting perk stuff
- add missing keyword descritpions
- proper phrasing of some stuff in the combat

**Classes**
- add missing stuff
- warlock definitly still needing lots of fleshing out

**Equipment**
- other useful items, books that give bonuses to lore checks (treats skill as 1 rank higher, can only be affected by [INT]/3 amount of books at the same time, no skill twice)
- magic item rules
- crafting rules
- cooking items

**Status Effects:**
- Confused Condition?

**Equipment:**
- isntead of masterwork, just list bonuses and cost increase that happen for each additional tier.

**Nice to have**
- have colored abilities and more icons
- create npc generator
- add missing abilities
