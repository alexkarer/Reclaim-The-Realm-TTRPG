### Riftland Travel
- Only Travel that should be worth considering at the start
- Proper codify that the longer one is in the Riftlands the more insane (mental injuries) one recievs
- Travel Encounters only give 1/4 XP.

Riftlands should not be made using a hexcrawl. They should be special and unkowable.
It should be a point crawl where each point leads to a different location. With many to choose.

There should be different Tiers of Riftlands which impact the location and environment effects the Pcs might encounter
- Tier I (Level 1-3)
- Tier II (Level 4-7)
- Tier III (level 8-11)
- TIer IV (Level 12)

**Ideas**
- Travelling from one rift point to antother requires going through portals
  - There are potentially multiple portals to choose one, some more dangerous than others and potentially harbouring more reward or being quicker.

**Questions**
- Rules for finding stuff?
- Rules for goin out?
- Long Rest allowed when?

### Camp Events
- Stuff that happens during camping in the Riftlands.

### Settlemetn Events
- Interresting THings that can happen in a settlement.


### Travelling outside Riftlands
- Travelling outside Riftlands should be done with montages and encounters predefined as soon as the party declares their travel intent, It should average out at ~1 Encounter every 3 days.
